                                                    `/` (Root Directory)
                                                    ====================

The `/` (root directory) is the top-level directory in a Linux file system.
All other directories, files, devices, and mounts branch out from this directory, forming a hierarchical structure.

The root directory is where the entire file system hierarchy begins.
It contains critical subdirectories required for the operating system to function.

Unlike in other operating systems (such as Windows, where drives are labeled separately),
 Linux mounts all file systems (local or remote) under this unified directory tree.

Common Subdirectories under `/`:
             ____________________________________________________________________________________________________
            |     Directory    |                            Description                                          |
            |__________________|_________________________________________________________________________________|
            | `/bin`           | Essential user binaries (e.g., common commands like `ls`, `cat`, `cp`, `mv`).   |
            | `/boot`          | Files required for booting, including the kernel and bootloader.                |
            | `/dev`           | Device files representing hardware components (e.g., `/dev/sda` for disks).     |
            | `/etc`           | System configuration files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/hostname`).              |
            | `/home`          | Home directories for users (e.g., `/home/user1`, `/home/user2`).                |
            | `/lib`           | Shared libraries required by binaries in `/bin` and `/sbin`.                    |
            | `/media`         | Mount point for removable media (e.g., USB drives, CDs).                        |
            | `/mnt`           | Temporary mount point for manually mounted filesystems.                         |
            | `/opt`           | Optional software packages and add-on applications.                             |
            | `/proc`          | Virtual filesystem providing information about running processes and the kernel.|
            | `/root`          | Home directory for the root (superuser) account.                                |
            | `/run`           | Runtime data for processes (e.g., PID files and sockets).                       |
            | `/sbin`          | Essential system binaries used by the superuser (e.g., `fsck`, `reboot`).       |
            | `/srv`           | Data for services provided by the system (e.g., web servers, FTP servers).      |
            | `/sys`           | Virtual filesystem providing information about hardware and system devices.     |
            | `/tmp`           | Temporary files created by applications.                                        |
            | `/usr`           | User utilities and applications (non-essential for booting).                    |
            | `/var`           | Variable data such as logs, caches, and spool files.                            |

Mount Points:
        In Linux, different filesystems and devices are mounted into the directory tree under the root (`/`) directory.
        Some common mount points include:
                1.`/mnt`   –  Used for temporary mounting of filesystems manually.
                2.`/media` –  Used for mounting removable media like USB drives and CDs automatically.
                3.`/boot`  –  Contains files needed for booting the system, such as the kernel and bootloader.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS):
        The structure of the `/` directory and its subdirectories follows the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), 
         which defines standard locations for files and directories in Unix-like operating systems.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key Points
        1.Single Root Hierarchy: 
                - Unlike Windows, Linux doesn’t use drive letters.
                - All devices and partitions are mounted under a single root (`/`) directory.
        2.Separation of Concerns: 
                - Critical system files, user files, application files, 
                  and temporary files are stored in different directories for better organization and management.
        3.Permissions: 
                - Access to most subdirectories under `/` requires superuser privileges,
                  ensuring the security of critical system files.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
'.' :
        - The current working directory is the directory that the user is currently in.
        - It is denoted by a dot (.) and is the default directory for the user.
'..' :
        - The parent directory is the directory that contains the current working directory.
        - The parent directory is used to navigate up the file system hierarchy.
        - It is denoted by a dot-dot (..) and is one level up in the
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion
        The `/` (root directory) is the foundation of the Linux filesystem hierarchy,
        containing essential subdirectories that organize files for different purposes,
        such as system binaries, libraries, configuration files, and user data.
        Proper understanding of these directories helps in managing,
        troubleshooting, and maintaining a Linux system effectively.
