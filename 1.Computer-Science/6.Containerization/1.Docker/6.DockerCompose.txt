        docker-compose up	                      Builds, (re)creates, starts, and attaches to containers for a service.
        docker-compose up -d	                      Runs containers in detached mode (in the background).
        docker-compose down	                      Stops and removes all containers, networks, and volumes created by docker-compose up.
        docker-compose build	                      Builds or rebuilds services defined in the docker-compose.yml file.
        docker-compose start	                      Starts containers that are already created but stopped.
        docker-compose stop	                      Stops running containers without removing them.
        docker-compose restart	                      Restarts all containers.
        docker-compose ps	                      Lists all containers and their current status for the project.
        docker-compose logs	                      Displays logs from all containers.
        docker-compose logs -f	                      Follows logs from all containers in real-time.
        docker-compose exec <service> <cmd>	      Executes a command inside a running service container.
        docker-compose run <service> <cmd>	      Runs a command in a new container for the specified service. 

                           -> Project and Configuration Management: 
        docker-compose config	                      Validates and prints the docker-compose.yml file.
        docker-compose config --services	      Lists all services defined in the docker-compose.yml file.
        docker-compose config --volumes	              Lists all volumes defined in the docker-compose.yml file.
        docker-compose config --profiles	      Lists all profiles defined in the docker-compose.yml file.
        docker-compose version	                      Displays the version of docker-compose. 


                           -> Service and Volume Management:
        docker-compose pull	                      Pulls service images specified in the docker-compose.yml file from the Docker registry.
        docker-compose push	                      Pushes built images to a Docker registry.
        docker-compose rm	                      Removes stopped service containers.
        docker-compose up --force-recreate	      Recreates all containers even if they haven't changed.
        docker-compose up --no-deps	              Starts only the specified service and skips dependencies.
        docker-compose down --volumes	              Removes the volumes created by docker-compose up.   


                           -> Scaling and Resource Management:
        docker-compose scale <service>=N	      Scales a service to N number of instances.
        docker-compose up --scale <svc>=N	      Combines scaling with starting services.


                           -> Advanced Options:
        docker-compose pause	                      Pauses running containers.
