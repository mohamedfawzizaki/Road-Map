                                        🔹 Outermost Blocks in the `http` Block  

The `http` block in Nginx is the main configuration block for handling HTTP/HTTPS traffic. Inside it, there are several top-level (outermost) blocks that define different functionalities.

 📌 Outermost Blocks Inside `http {}`
The `http` block contains these key outer blocks:
1. `server {}` – Defines a virtual host for handling HTTP requests.  
2. `upstream {}` – Defines a group of backend servers for load balancing.  
3. `map {}` – Creates key-value mappings for variables.  
4. `geo {}` – Defines geographical mappings based on IP addresses.  
5. `limit_req_zone {}` – Configures request rate limiting.  
6. `log_format {}` – Defines custom log formats.  
7. `proxy_cache_path {}` – Configures cache storage locations.

 🔹 1️⃣ `server {}` Block (Virtual Host)
Defines how Nginx should handle requests for a domain.  
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````nginx
http {
    server {
        listen 80;
        server_name example.com;

        location / {
            root /var/www/html;
        }
    }
}
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
✅ This serves files from `/var/www/html` for `example.com`.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

 🔹 2️⃣ `upstream {}` Block (Load Balancing)
Defines a group of backend servers.  
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````nginx
http {
    upstream backend {
        server 192.168.1.100;
        server 192.168.1.101;
    }

    server {
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://backend;
        }
    }
}
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
✅ Requests to `/` are distributed across two backend servers.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

 🔹 3️⃣ `map {}` Block (Key-Value Mapping)
Creates custom variables based on request conditions.  
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````nginx
http {
    map $http_user_agent $mobile {
        default 0;
        ~iphone|android 1;
    }

    server {
        location / {
            if ($mobile) {
                return 302 /mobile-version.html;
            }
        }
    }
}
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
✅ Redirects mobile users to `/mobile-version.html`.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

 🔹 4️⃣ `geo {}` Block (Geographical IP Mapping)
Assigns variables based on client IP address.  
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````nginx
http {
    geo $country {
        default US;
        192.168.1.0/24 EU;
    }

    server {
        location / {
            add_header X-Country $country;
        }
    }
}
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
✅ Sets `$country` based on client IP.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

 🔹 5️⃣ `limit_req_zone {}` Block (Rate Limiting)
Defines request rate limits.  
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````nginx
http {
    limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=mylimit:10m rate=5r/s;

    server {
        location /api/ {
            limit_req zone=mylimit burst=10;
        }
    }
}
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
✅ Limits clients to 5 requests per second.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

 🔹 6️⃣ `log_format {}` Block (Custom Logging)
Defines custom log formats.  
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````nginx
http {
    log_format main '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] "$request" '
                     '$status $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
                     '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';

    access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log main;
}
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
✅ Stores logs in `/var/log/nginx/access.log`.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

 🔹 7️⃣ `proxy_cache_path {}` Block (Caching)
Defines cache storage and rules.  
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````nginx
http {
    proxy_cache_path /var/cache/nginx levels=1:2 keys_zone=my_cache:10m inactive=60m;
}
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
✅ Caches content for 60 minutes.
