Hereâ€™s a **secure and optimized `.htaccess` file** for your Laravel project. This configuration is designed to:

1. **Restrict access to sensitive files and directories.**
2. **Only allow access to the `public/` directory.**
3. **Protect against common security threats (e.g., directory listing, unauthorized access).**
4. **Improve performance with caching and compression.**

### **Explanation of Key Features**

1. **Restrict Access to Non-Public Files:**
   - The `RewriteRule ^(?!public/).* - [F,L]` ensures only the `public/` folder is accessible.

2. **Protect Sensitive Files:**
   - Deny access to `.env`, `.htaccess`, `composer.json`, `phpunit.xml`, etc., with the `<FilesMatch>` rule.

3. **Prevent Directory Listing:**
   - `Options -Indexes` ensures that directory contents cannot be listed.

4. **Restrict Access to `storage` and `vendor` Folders:**
   - `<DirectoryMatch "/(storage|vendor)/"> Require all denied </DirectoryMatch>` blocks direct access to these folders.

5. **Enable Security Headers:**
   - Includes headers for clickjacking prevention, XSS protection, and MIME sniffing protection.

6. **Enable HTTPS:**
   - Strict Transport Security (HSTS) forces browsers to use HTTPS if SSL is enabled.

7. **Caching Rules:**
   - Improve performance by defining expiration times for static assets like images, CSS, and JavaScript files.

8. **Block Malicious Bots:**
   - Denies access to known malicious crawlers using `SetEnvIfNoCase`.

### **Important Notes**
1. **Web Server Must Be Configured Correctly:**
   - Ensure the web server is pointing to the `public/` folder as the document root.
2. **Test the Configuration:**
   - Use tools like [Apache config checker](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/apachectl.html) to validate your `.htaccess` file.
3. **SSL/HTTPS:**
   - Ensure HTTPS is enabled to fully leverage security headers.

This `.htaccess` configuration provides a secure baseline while allowing Laravel to function seamlessly.
