    1.Stream:
            - stdin   :  
                        - Input stream  (file descriptor 0).
            - stdout  : 
                       - Output stream  (file descriptor 1).
                       - example:
                                echo "Hello, World!" >   file.txt      override
                                echo "Hello, World!" 1>  file.txt      override
                                echo "Hello, World!" 1>> file.txt      append
            - stderr  :  
                       - Error stream  (file descriptor 2).
                       - example:
                                echo "Hello, World!" 2>  file.txt      override
                                echo "Hello, World!" 2>> file.txt      append 
    2.Redirection ('>'1>'>>'1>>'______'2>'2>>'______'<'):
            - Redirecting input/output streams to files.
            - Redirecting input/output streams to other processes.
            - Redirecting input/output streams to devices.
    3.Pipes('|'):
            - Connecting processes through pipes.
            - Pipes are unidirectional.
            - Pipes are used for inter-process communication (IPC).
    4.Filters('grep'):
            - Filters are used to process data.
            - Filters are used to transform data.


    5.Process:
            - A process is an instance of a program.
            - A process has its own memory space
            - A process has its own set of open files
            - A process has its own set of open network connections
    6.Threads:
            - A thread is a lightweight process.
            - A thread shares the same memory space as the parent process.
            - A thread has its own stack.
    7.Fork:
            - Fork is a system call that creates a new process.
            - The new process is a copy of the parent process.
            - The new process has its own memory space
            - The new process has its own set of open files
            - The new process has its own set of open network connections
    8.Exec:
            - Exec is a system call that replaces the current process image with a new one
            - The new process image is loaded from a file
            - The new process image is executed in the same memory space as the parent process
