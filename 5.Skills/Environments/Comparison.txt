"composer create-project laravel/laravel my-laravel-app"
"composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel my-laravel-app"

When Should You Use --prefer-dist?
        When you want a faster installation.
        When you don't need the Git history or source control from the repository.
        For production environments where you won't modify the core package.
When Should You Skip --prefer-dist?
        When you're actively developing or debugging Laravel itself (e.g., contributing to the framework) and need the full Git repository.
